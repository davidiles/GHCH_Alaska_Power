# Motivation

The goal of this study is to evaluate the sample size requirements to estimate population sizes of Gray-headed Chickadee in Alaska.

# Simulation description

The simulation assumes that bird territories are distributed randomly across available habitat, and that territory boundaries do not overlap.

```{r, include=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
load("power_wksp.RData")
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Simulation results

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

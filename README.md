# Motivation

The goal of this study is to evaluate the sample size requirements to
estimate population sizes of Gray-headed Chickadee in Alaska.

# Simulation description

The simulation assumes that bird territories are distributed randomly
across available habitat and that bird territory boundaries do not
overlap. These simulations assume the area of potentially suitable GHCH
habitat in AK is 1.0117^{4} km^2.

# Simulation results

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

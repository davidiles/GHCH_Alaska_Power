# Motivation

The goal of this study is to evaluate the sample size requirements to
estimate population sizes of Gray-headed Chickadee in Alaska.

# Simulation description

The simulation assumes that bird territories are distributed randomly
across available habitat, and that territory boundaries do not overlap.

# Simulation results

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
